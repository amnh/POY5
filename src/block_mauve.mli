* output two code array of matching blocks, a cost_mat between lcb blocks and non-lcb
* blocks, ali_mat is the cost and alignment sequence between lcb blocks.
* NOTE: edit_cost is the total editing cost between lcb blocks (which is not included
* is cost_mat), full_cost_listlst is a little bit redundant here, for it
* contains the two code array, but it also has the begin and end point of each
* block. *)
